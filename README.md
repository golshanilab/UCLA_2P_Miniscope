# UCLA 2P Miniscope 
UCLA miniature multiphoton microscope resources and design files.

The UCLA miniscope project is an open-source inititive to design open-source miniature microscopes for neuroscience. Here, we present a multiphoton miniature microscope developed at UCLA which is able to record from fine structures like dendrites, or several hundred microns into tissue.<br>

In this Git repository, we openly share all of the design files for this microscope with the community, these include: <br>
  - Mechanical Design Files (in .STEP format)
  - Optical Design Files (ZEMAX .ZARs)
  - Electronic PCB Designs (GERBER)
  - Control Software (Matlab and Waveforms)

<br>
As well as additional information to support users in setting up these devices, such as:

  - Suite2P analysis .ops to aid in analysis
  - A pre-trained DeepLabCut Network
  - ScanImage Machine Data Files and Configuration files
<br>

For additional information, please take a look at our bioRxiv paper [here](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.03.29.586663v1)

Here are some fancy images that show off what the microscope is capable of!
