Please load the "UCLA_2P_Miniscope.dwf3wavegen" file using the Digilent Waveforms software. 

This will give you the ability to control critical functionality of the microscope including
1. X drive waveform
2. Clock signals for MEMS amplifier
3. Generation of line clock pulse for sync w/ scanimage 

In the future, we will also implement the i2c functions to control the ETL
